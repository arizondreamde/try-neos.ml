<div class="neos-contentcollection"><p>We as Neos development team have always believed that the community plays a vital role in shaping the future of the framework and CMS. Therefore, before the release, we reached out to the Neos community to understand their needs better. The team asked the community about the most requested features and the most frustrating aspects of using Neos. The response was overwhelming, with a multitude of messages pouring in. We collected all the ideas and feedback in our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener external" href="https://discuss.neos.io/t/attention-neos-community/6206">forum</a> and are excited to announce that some of these ideas will be included in this latest release. We as the Neos team would like to express our gratitude to the Neos community for the valuable feedback and ideas that helped shape the latest release and as we could not implement all the feedback for 8.3, we are looking to a bright future of new Neos releases.</p><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 [&amp;&gt;*&gt;:where(p,ul,ol,figure):first-child]:mt-0 [&amp;&gt;*&gt;:where(p,ul,ol,figure):last-child]:mb-0 sm:grid-cols-2"><div class="neos-contentcollection"><h2>Neos 8.3 Highlights</h2><ul><li>New @private props for <strong>Neos.Fusion:Component</strong></li><li>New commands for handling Image variants</li><li>A new Assets Eel Helper</li><li>Better user experience for Node Type handling</li></ul></div><div class="neos-contentcollection"><h2>Flow 8.3 Highlights</h2><ul><li>Adding cache lifetime to routing MatchResult and ResolveResult DTOs</li><li>New validators MediaType, FileExtension and FileSize</li></ul></div></div><h2>Neos UI 8.3 Highlights</h2><ul><li>Improve user experience for Dimension Switcher</li><li>Improve node creation dialog user experience</li><li>Document tree nodes can be opened in a new tab/window via right click</li></ul></div>DescendantOf_%d0dbe915091d400bd8ee7f27f0791303%_346a22d8-d404-4c80-a918-e89edd3af41d Node_%d0dbe915091d400bd8ee7f27f0791303%_346a22d8-d404-4c80-a918-e89edd3af41d0             1882
