                                                    much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear!

                                                    occurred to
                                                    her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all

                                                    and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,

                                                    across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either

                                                    curiosity, she
                                                    ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop
                                                    down a large
                                                    rabbit-hole under the hedge.

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her disappointment it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p></div></div></div><div class="neos-contentcollection"><div class="md:flex md:flex-wrap md:gap-4 md:flex-row"><figure class="md:mb-0"><img src="http://34.159.13.82/_Resources/Persistent/9/a/e/a/9aea4dff87ebecfd0400a0ce8b1ac8886a33cc65/alice-2-200x283.jpg" class="w-full max-w-none" /></figure><div class="min-w-[30ch] flex-1"><p>Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, "Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to——" At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out "The Queen! The Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p></div></div></div></div></div>DescendantOf_%d0dbe915091d400bd8ee7f27f0791303%_55861d58-c4e5-6121-b7cf-ef9320ebfbb0 Node_%d0dbe915091d400bd8ee7f27f0791303%_55861d58-c4e5-6121-b7cf-ef9320ebfbb00             5215
