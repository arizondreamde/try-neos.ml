                                                    get dry again: they had a
                                                    consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
                                                    natural to
                                                    Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had

                                                    her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who
                                                    at last
                                                    turned sulky, and would only say, "I am older than you, and
                                                    must know
                                                    better;" and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old
                                                    it was,
                                                    and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
